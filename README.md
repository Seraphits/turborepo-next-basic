Architecture Overview: The "Steel Thread" Monorepo
1. System Architecture: This project utilizes a high-performance Turborepo monorepo architecture managed by pnpm workspaces. It is designed to support multiple consumer applications (apps/) sharing a unified, versioned logic and design system (packages/).

2. Shared Styling Architecture (The "Hybrid" Engine): The design system implements a Hybrid Token Architecture that bridges compile-time safety with runtime flexibility:

Abstract Layer: A centralized SCSS library (packages/ui/src/styles) following the 7-1 Pattern, housing global variables, mixins, and functions.

Hybrid Token Generation: An automated SCSS loop maps static Sass variables (Source of Truth) to dynamic CSS Custom Properties (Delivery Mechanism). This enables efficient runtime theming (e.g., Dark Mode) while maintaining strict build-time governance.

Compiler Integration: Custom Next.js Compiler Configuration (sassOptions.includePaths) is injected into every application, enabling clean, alias-based imports (e.g., @use "variables") without fragile relative paths.

3. The "Steel Thread" CI/CD Pipeline: The infrastructure implements a stratified verification strategy to ensure zero-regression delivery. Every commit traverses a "Steel Thread"—an unbroken line of automated quality gates:

Structural Defense (Static Analysis):

Tools: ESLint, TypeScript (Strict Mode).

Function: Analyzes code at rest for syntax hygiene, type safety, and architectural violations before execution begins.

Logic Defense (Micro-Testing):

Tools: Vitest, JSDOM, React Testing Library.

Function: Executes unit tests within the packages/ui library using a simulated browser environment. This ensures individual atomic components (the "Lego blocks") function correctly in isolation.

Systemic Defense (Macro-Testing):

Tools: Playwright E2E.

Architecture: Implements an Isolated Testing Strategy. The pipeline dynamically builds and spins up only the application under test (e.g., ReadBoot on Port 3002) to verify server reachability and critical user flows in a real browser engine.

Continuous Delivery:

Tools: Vercel.

Function: Automated, parallel deployments of three distinct projects (ReadBoot, Scrambled Sounds, Pattern Lab) from a single git repository, utilizing command overrides to map monorepo paths to production outputs.






# Turborepo starter

This Turborepo starter is maintained by the Turborepo core team.

## Using this example

Run the following command:

```sh
npx create-turbo@latest
```

## What's inside?

This Turborepo includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `docs`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `web`: another [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `@repo/ui`: a stub React component library shared by both `web` and `docs` applications
- `@repo/eslint-config`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `@repo/typescript-config`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This Turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo

# With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended)
turbo build

# Without [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation), use your package manager
npx turbo build
yarn dlx turbo build
pnpm exec turbo build
```

You can build a specific package by using a [filter](https://turborepo.com/docs/crafting-your-repository/running-tasks#using-filters):

```
# With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended)
turbo build --filter=docs

# Without [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation), use your package manager
npx turbo build --filter=docs
yarn exec turbo build --filter=docs
pnpm exec turbo build --filter=docs
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo

# With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended)
turbo dev

# Without [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation), use your package manager
npx turbo dev
yarn exec turbo dev
pnpm exec turbo dev
```

You can develop a specific package by using a [filter](https://turborepo.com/docs/crafting-your-repository/running-tasks#using-filters):

```
# With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended)
turbo dev --filter=web

# Without [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation), use your package manager
npx turbo dev --filter=web
yarn exec turbo dev --filter=web
pnpm exec turbo dev --filter=web
```

### Remote Caching

> [!TIP]
> Vercel Remote Cache is free for all plans. Get started today at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/signup?/signup?utm_source=remote-cache-sdk&utm_campaign=free_remote_cache).

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turborepo.com/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup?utm_source=turborepo-examples), then enter the following commands:

```
cd my-turborepo

# With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended)
turbo login

# Without [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation), use your package manager
npx turbo login
yarn exec turbo login
pnpm exec turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your Turborepo:

```
# With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended)
turbo link

# Without [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation), use your package manager
npx turbo link
yarn exec turbo link
pnpm exec turbo link
```
